"A supermarket needs to allocate various products, including high-demand items like the Sony Alpha Refrigerator, Sony Bravia XR, and Sony PlayStation 5, across different retail shelves. The product values and space requirements are provided in the ""Products.csv"" dataset. Additionally, the store has multiple shelves, each with a total space limit and specific space constraints for Sony and Apple products, as outlined in the ""Capacity.csv"" file. The goal is to determine the optimal number of units of each Sony product to place on each shelf to maximize total value while ensuring that the space used by Sony products on each shelf does not exceed the brand-specific limits. The decision variables x_ij represent the number of units of product i to be placed on shelf j.

"A company is planning a digital marketing campaign for 5 products (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5) targeted to 7 distinct user groups (U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, U6, U7). Given the following data (provided in CSV files):

ConversionRate.csv: Predicted conversion probability from exposure to purchase for every [Product, User Group] combination.
CostperExposure.csv: Cost incurred per exposure for each [Product, User Group] combination in dollars.
BrandFitScore.csv: Brand fit score (decimal) for each (Product, UserGroup) pair. Score indicating how well each product matches each user group's preferences.
ExposureCaps(per User Group).csv: Maximum exposures allowed for each (Product, UserGroup) pair (hard cap per pair).
ProductMinExposures.csv: The minimum total exposure of each product. The total exposure of a product should be the sum of the exposure of all 7 user groups.
To avoid spamming, each user group has a maximum number of exposures they can receive across all products. Each product has a minimum campaign exposure requirement for market presence, and the average brand fit across all exposures must not be below a set target. ExposureCaps(per User Group).csv states the information of risk exposure of each product of each user group; ProductMinExposure.csv shows the minimum exposure requirement of each product. User group exposures for each product cannot exceed the value in the cell of ExposureCaps(per User Group).csv. Each product must have at least the ""Product min exposures"" across all groups in ProductMinExposures.csv.

Total marketing budget: $2,100 (i.e., exposures *cost must not exceed this sum)
Average brand fit (across all exposures) must be at least 0.75.
All exposures must be integers (send whole exposures).
