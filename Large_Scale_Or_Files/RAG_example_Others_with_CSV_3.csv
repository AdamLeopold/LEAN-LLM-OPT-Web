"A logistics company needs to schedule three trucks daily to transport goods and meet customer demand across four time periods. Each truck has specific startup and transportation costs. The customer demand for the four time periods is [1,500 kg, 2,000 kg, 1,800 kg, 1,000 kg]. The company must follow these operating rules:

First, trucks have minimum runtime and cooldown requirements. Once a truck is started, it must run continuously for at least 2 hours before being shut down. If turned off, it must remain idle for at least 1 hour before it can be restarted.

Second, there are limits on load fluctuations. For each individual truck, the change in transported weight between two adjacent periods cannot exceed 300 kg.

Additionally, the company must always maintain a 10% spare capacity buffer for emergency orders. This means the total transported weight in any period must not exceed 90% of the combined maximum capacity of the trucks **active in that period**.

The goal is to find the lowest-cost scheduling solution that meets all the above constraints while fulfilling customer demand. Associated paramters are detailed in 'parameters.csv'",Large_Scale_Or_Files/Other_example/model9/parameters.csv,"### **Model Formulation**

#### **1. Indices and Sets**

The model uses the following indices to structure the problem:

* $i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$: An index representing each **truck**.
* $t \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$: An index representing each **time period**.

#### **2. Parameters**

These are the known inputs to the model:

* $d_t$: Customer **demand** in period $t$ (kg).
* $Q_i$: Maximum **load capacity** of truck $i$ (kg).
* $SC_i$: **Startup cost** for truck $i$ ($).
* $TC_i$: **Transportation cost** for truck $i$ ($/kg).

#### **3. Decision Variables**

The model solves for these variables to find the optimal solution:

* $x_{i,t} \ge 0$: A continuous variable for the **load** transported by truck $i$ in period $t$ (kg).
* $y_{i,t} \in \{0, 1\}$: A binary variable that is **1** if truck $i$ is **ON** in period $t$, and **0** otherwise.
* $s_{i,t} \in \{0, 1\}$: A binary variable that is **1** if truck $i$ is **started up** at the beginning of period $t$, and **0** otherwise.

#### **4. Objective Function**

The objective is to **minimize the total cost**, which is the sum of all startup and transportation costs.
$$
\min Z = \sum_{i=1}^{3} \sum_{t=1}^{4} (SC_i \cdot s_{i,t} + TC_i \cdot x_{i,t})
$$

#### **5. Constraints**

The solution must satisfy the following operational rules:

**Demand Satisfaction:** The total load from all trucks must exactly meet customer demand in each period.
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{i,t} = d_t \quad \forall t \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}
$$

**Spare Capacity Buffer:** The total load transported must not exceed 80% of the combined capacity of the trucks that are **currently active**.
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{i,t} \le 0.90 \sum_{i=1}^{3} (Q_i \cdot y_{i,t}) \quad \forall t \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}
$$

**Truck Load Bounds:** A truck's load cannot exceed its maximum capacity. If the truck is inactive, its load must be zero.
$$
x_{i,t} \le Q_i \cdot y_{i,t} \quad \forall i, t
$$

**Startup Logic:** A startup event occurs if a truck was OFF in the previous period and is ON in the current one. It is assumed all trucks are OFF before period 1 ($y_{i,0}=0$).
$$
s_{i,t} \ge y_{i,t} - y_{i,t-1} \quad \forall i, t \quad (\text{where } y_{i,0} = 0)
$$

**Minimum Runtime:** If a truck starts, it must remain ON for at least two consecutive periods.
$$
y_{i,t} + y_{i,t+1} \ge 2 \cdot s_{i,t} \quad \forall i, t \in \{1, 2, 3\}
$$

**Minimum Downtime:** A truck that is shut down must remain off for at least one period. This prevents an ON-OFF-ON sequence.
$$
y_{i,t-1} + y_{i,t+1} \le y_{i,t} + 1 \quad \forall i, t \in \{2, 3\}
$$

**Load Fluctuation (Ramping):** The load of any single truck cannot change by more than 200 kg between adjacent periods. This absolute value constraint is linearized into two separate constraints.
$$
x_{i,t} - x_{i,t-1} \le 300 \quad \forall i, t \in \{2, 3, 4\}
$$

$$
x_{i,t-1} - x_{i,t} \le 300 \quad \forall i, t \in \{2, 3, 4\}
$$
