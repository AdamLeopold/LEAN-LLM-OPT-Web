"Walmart stores play a critical role in supplying essential goods to various customer groups on a daily basis. The problem involves determining the optimal transportation plan that satisfies the demands of 4 customer groups, whose daily demand data is provided in ""customer_demands.csv"". These demands must be met using supplies from 3 Walmart stores, each with a specific daily supply capacity detailed in ""supply_capacity.csv"". The transportation cost per unit of goods from each Walmart store to each customer group is recorded in ""transportation_costs.csv"". The objective is to determine the quantity of goods transported from each Walmart store to each customer group, ensuring that all demands are met without exceeding the supply capacity of any store, while minimizing the total transportation cost.","Large_Scale_Or_Files/TP_example/customer_demand.csv

"Educational planners must be able to address the travel-time issue, while striving to satisfy other requirements. One approach to the problem is to consider racial balance, school capacity, and population of the school district as constraints, while striving to transport the children with as little inconvenience to them as possible . Suppose the Capital City School District has two elementary schools, with individual capacities in school_capacity.csv,there are three neighborhoods with the elementary school populations as summarized in neighborhoods_population.csv and the distance in miles from school to neighborhoods is in distance.csv. The district has decided to integrate by school rather than by grade level. A school will be considered to be in racial balance when it deviates by no more than 10 percent from the district ratio of 60 percent white and 40 percent nonwhite . The district wishes to devise a busing plan that will transport pupils to any school in the same racial ratio as their neighborhood and will minimize the distance the youngsters must travel.","Large_Scale_Or_Files/Other_example/11/school_capacity.csv

### Sets and Indices
- $i = 1,2$: School index ($1=$ School I, $2=$ School II)
- $j = 1,2,3$: Neighborhood index ($1=$ A, $2=$ B, $3=$ C)

---

### Decision Variables

- $x_{ij}^w$: Number of white students assigned from neighborhood $j$ to school $i$
- $x_{ij}^{nw}$: Number of nonwhite students assigned from neighborhood $j$ to school $i$

---

### Objective Function

Minimize total transportation cost:
$$
\min \sum_{i=1}^2 \sum_{j=1}^3 d_{ij} \cdot \left( x_{ij}^w + x_{ij}^{nw} \right)
$$

---

### Constraints

**1. Assignment Constraints (All students from each neighborhood must be assigned):**
For each neighborhood $j$,
$$
\sum_{i=1}^2 x_{ij}^w = P_j^w, \qquad \sum_{i=1}^2 x_{ij}^{nw} = P_j^{nw} \qquad \forall j = 1,2,3
$$

**2. School Capacity Constraints (Total assigned students to each school cannot exceed its capacity):**
For each school $i$,
$$
\sum_{j=1}^3 (x_{ij}^w + x_{ij}^{nw}) \leq S_i \qquad \forall i = 1,2
$$

**3. Racial Balance Constraints (Each school's white and nonwhite ratio must be within 10% of the district ratio):**

District ratio: 60% white, 40% nonwhite.

For each school $i$,
$$
0.5 \leq
\frac{\sum_{j=1}^3 x_{ij}^w}{\sum_{j=1}^3 (x_{ij}^w + x_{ij}^{nw})}
\leq 0.7 \qquad \forall i = 1,2
$$

**4. Nonnegativity:**
$$
x_{ij}^w \geq 0, \quad x_{ij}^{nw} \geq 0 \qquad \forall i = 1,2;\ j = 1,2,3
$$
